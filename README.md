# Maggi Learning
Maggi Learning, a desktop application, with the aim to help people learn "How stuff works" without spending time reading it. The tool presented information about topics which user is interested in, in 2-3 lines. The UI was designed such that users didn't had to read the information, but rather glance it and within 3-4 seconds get the content in their short term memory. 

Such information when presented over a period of time can be very effective and people can asynchronously learn a lot without Googling and reading the whole page of information.
